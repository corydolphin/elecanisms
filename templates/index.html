      <h4>Meet TankFollower</h4>
      <p>Meet TankFollower, a versatile, following robot built in six weeks for Elecanisms, an electrical and mechanical prototyping course at Olin College of Engineering.</p>
      <p>
        Our externally facing goal was to design and build, a versatile, autonomous robot that follows a person. Internally, our goal was to continue learning about the integration of mechanical, electrical, and software systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were able to build a treaded robot that followed a user, but we would have liked to achieve a more robust following behavior. Given more time, we would improve upon the control system and iterate on the treads. The combination of a basic control algorithm and not enough friction to reliably skid steer made the following behavior unreliable.
